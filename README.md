# Chatbot with NLP


## Overview

This repository contains a simple chatbot model implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot uses a retrieval-based approach with TF-IDF and cosine similarity for response generation. It can handle greetings, respond to general queries, and provide relevant information.

## Features

- Greeting functionality: The chatbot can respond to common greetings like "hello," "hi," and "hey."

- Retrieval-based response: The chatbot finds the most similar response from its knowledge base using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

- Entity Recognition: The chatbot uses spaCy for named entity recognition (NER) to identify specific information like names, dates, and locations in user input.

- Ambiguity Handling: The chatbot can handle ambiguous queries and ask for clarification when necessary.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:
2. install spacy
3. Enter your query or ask a question to the chatbot.

4. The chatbot will respond with the most relevant answer based on the input.

5. Type "bye" to exit the conversation.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's knowledge base by editing the `chatbot.txt` file. Add new responses and information to improve the chatbot's accuracy.

To add more advanced features, consider using deep learning models for response generation or fine-tuning the existing models for better entity recognition.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the chatbot can be evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. Ground truth labels and predicted labels are used to calculate these metrics. Currently, the chatbot's performance is as follows:

- Precision: 0.75
- Recall: 0.75
- F1-Score: 0.75

## Ethical Considerations

When developing chatbot models, it's crucial to consider ethical aspects. Ensure the chatbot provides accurate and unbiased information, avoids offensive language, and respects user privacy.
